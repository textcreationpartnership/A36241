##Content Summary##

#####Front#####

1. THE CONTENTS.

#####Body#####

1. § I. The Doctor's late Book, no Answer to the Vindication.

1. § II. The Baroccian M S, disproved by the Vindicator, and not defended by the Doctor.

1. § III. He has not offered at any Answer to the Arguments against him in the first part of the Vindication.

1. He also grants the Proposition principally disputed between Us concerning the Invalidity of Lay-deprivations, and takes no care to prevent the Consequences of that Confession.

1. § V. The Doctor gains nothing by his changing the state of the Qustion.

1. § VI. The Doctor's whole Proof unconclusive, admitting the Invalidity of Lay-deprivations.

1. § VII. The Doctor's limitations of his own pretended self-evident Maxime, do all of them prove our Case unconcerned in it. Chap. 1.

1. § VIII. Submission of Subjects to the Ecclesiastical Usurpers is sinful by the Law of God.

1. § IX. Such Submission would make the Ecclesiastical Subjects Accomplices in the Injustice.

1. § X. The same submission in the Clergy is sinful, on account of the Oaths they have taken to the of Rightful Possessors Canonical Obedience.

1. § XI. Our Principles afford better Reasons why the unjust deprivations of Synods may be received without the deprivea Bishops consent, than those insisted on by the Doctor.

1. § XII. There is gre•• disparity between the Obligations of a competent, and an incompetent, Authority.

1. § XIII No reason to reckon on the persumed consent of the Bishops injured by an Invalid deprivation, for discharging their Subjects Consciences from Duty to them.

1. § XIV. Our deprived Fathers give publick Significations that they do challenge their old Rights, as far as is necessary in their Circumstances.

1. § XV. The Oaths of canonical Obedience to our Fathers still obliging.

1. § XVI. The complyance with Usurpers is also therefore sinful, because Usurping Bishops are really no Bishops at all.

1.  § XVII. The Evil of Sin, and Scandal in complying, greater than that of Persecution which is avoided by it.

1. §. XVIII. The Evil of Schism not avoided, but incurred, by complying with the Usurpers.

1. § XXI. The abuses that may follow on Compliance, are a just reason to refuse it, where it is not otherwise, in Conscience, due

1. § XX. No security •ere that compliance will not be abused.

1. § XXI. That abuse it a greater mischief than that it can be made a mends for by the Doctors Expedients.

1. § XXII. The main dedsign of the Doctors new Book in arguing from Facts already overthrown by the Vindicator, yet no notice taken of what was there said.

1. § XXIII. The Doctor himself is unwilling to stand by the Consequences of such like Facts as himself produces.

1. § XXIV. The Doctors remark against the Reasoning of the First Parts of the Vindication concerning the Possession of Cornelius turned against himself.

1. § XXV. The Doctor's Book offorded no Subject for a Reply, but what would be Personal.

1. § XXVI. The Doctor's turning the Dispute to later Facts draws it from a short and decisive, to a tedious and litigious, Issue.

1. § XXVII. We have no reason to suffer our selves to be overruled by him in these Arts of diverting Us.

1. § XXVIII. We decline his Topick of Facts, rather because it is undecisive than because we think it disadvantageous to Us.

1. § XXIX. For want of some other Subject relating to the Vindication, we here pitch on the Case of Abiathar.

1. § XXX. This Fact is not commended in the Scripture as a Precedent.

1. § XXXI. The Magistrate could not by the Doctrine of that Age, have any direct Power over the Priest-hood.

1. §. XXXII. The Benefits of the Priest-hood out of the Power, and far greater than any in the Power, of the Civil Magistrate.

1. § XXXIII. The ancient Jews of the Apostle's Age did believe their Priest hood available to a future and a eternal state.

1. § XXXIV. And consequently, did expresly own it for mor Honourable than the Magistracy it self.

1. § XXXV. This same Reasonning holds on account of the Priest representing GOD, though without relation to a Future State.

1. § XXXVI. And that also according to the Opinions of those times.

1. § XXXVII. Solomons Act on Abiathar was only of Force.

1. § XXXVIII. VVhich Force might, in the Consequence render the Exercise of his Right impracticable.

1. § XXXIX. Yet Solomon was in Conscience obliged to be cautions in exercising this Force against the Priest-hood.

1. § XL. What Solomon did was only to fullfill what GOD had before threatned against the Family of Eli.

1. § XLI. Abiathar was not then the High-Priest▪ properly so called, but Zadok.

1. § XLII. There were in those times two High-Priests at once; the chief, such as Zadok was, of the Family of Eleazar, the lower, such as Abiathar, of the Family of Ithamar.

1. § XLIII. No deprivation of the Posterity of Phineas in those times.

1. § XLIV. Zadok put in the room of Abiathar, as to the Courses of Ithamar, which were not under him before.

1. § XLV. The Jews, by our Principles, could not justify a separation on account of Abiathar. Their Case not like Ours.

1. § LXVI. When Invasions had passed into a Prescription, as in our Soviour's time, he that was in Possession had really the best Title.

1. § XLVII. Among the Jews, the true High-Priest was to be known by his possessing the One Altar. Among th Christians, the true Altar was known by its being possessed by the true Bishop.

1. § XLVIII. The Reasons for Exemption from the Power of the Prince stronger on our deprived Fathers Case, than in the Case of Abiathar. Our Bishops are properly Priests.

1. § XLIX. The Gospel Priest-hood more Noble than that of Abiathar. The same Reasoning therefore holds now which did then; but now more strongly.

1. § L. This Reasoning was admitted in the Apostolical Age. Particularly by Clemens Romanus. He also Vindicates the Churches Rights against Lay-deprivations from Jewish Precedents.

1. §. LI. He does it also by the same Principles, as by him owned agreeable to the Constitution of the Gospel.

1. § LII. He draws the like Inferences from those Reasonings, in Practice, as we do.

1. § LIII. The Laity cannot now pretend to any Indirect Right of depriving Bishops, as the Jewish Princes could in the Case of the Jewish Priesthood.

1. § LIV. Our Reasoning against the Magistrates Right of deprivation in Spiritual proceed Universally, and therefore in Case of Temporal Crimes, also the owning such a Power would have been Pernicious to the Primitive Christians also, who were charged with Temporal Crimes▪

1. § LV. The Spiritual Rights of Our Fathers have been now invaded by Civil Force. Bare Characters. without Districts not sufficient to preserve the Church as a Body.

1. § LVI. Supposing the Church and Christian State had made one Body, yet more had been requisite to make that Supposition applicable to our present Case, which is not yet taken notice of.

1. § LVII. The Prince〈◊〉 account of his being only a Christian, has no Title to any Spiritual Authority.

1. § LVIII. A whole Nation, by Baptism, may be made one Society in the Church, without prejudice to their being still a Society distinct from it.

1. § LIX The Church's Obligations are more necessary for the subsisting of the State, than those she receives from the State are for hers.

1. § LX. The Benefits received by the State from the Church, are also greater than those which the Church receives from the State.

1. § LXI. If the State had been capable of conferring the greater Obligations, yet a good Pious Magistrate could not, in reason, desire su•h a recompence as should oblige the Church to yield any of her Ancient Rights.

1. § LXII, Princes have been allowed by the Church a Right to keep Persons out, not yet Canonically possessed; but not to turn any out, who were already in Possession of Bishopricks. And that without any proper Cession of Right on the Church's part.

1. § LXIII. The Power of turning out Bishops once Possessed, too great to be granted on any Consideration whatsoever.

1. § LXIV. In this Case, particularly, no Temporal Favour whatsoever can make amends for the loss of the benefits of the Spiritual So ciety. There can therefore be no implicite Contracts for such an Exchange that can in Equity oblige the Ecclesiastical Governours to performance, tho' it had been in their Power to make such a Contract.

1. § LXV. But here it is not in the Power of the Ecclesiastical Governours to make such a Contract.

1. § LXVI. It is not agreeable to the mind of GOD, that the Church should so concorporate with the State, as that the Bishops should be deprivable at the pleasure of the Civil Magistrate.

1. § LXVII. The Magistrate is by no means, a Competent Iudge of the Church's Interests.

1. § LXVIII. The Surrendry of the Clergy in Henry the VIIIth's time, cannot oblige their Posterits now.

1. § LXIX. No Reasoning from the Rights of the Jewish Princes to the Rights of Christian Princes now.

1. § LXX. Our Present deprivations not justifiable by even our present Secular Laws.

1. § LXXI, The Conclusion.
